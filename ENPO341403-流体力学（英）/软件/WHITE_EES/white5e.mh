--Sample Executable Cookie (This text is not necessary as part of the cookie)
--The first line is the file to launch. (It can be .exe or .html and should be in the same folder as the Autorun.exe file)
--No additional lines are necessary in this cookie, although some could be added and 'checked' for validity (i.e. version #, etc)
--If no .mh 'cookie' exists, the text and graphics in the splash.txt and splash.jpg files will be displayed on every launch.
--With no .mh 'cookie' file, the autorun.exe file will then launch the first .exe or index.html file it finds.
--The cookie can be named anything, as long as it has a .mh extension.
--The cookie is stored in the PC Windows/WinNT directory or the MAC default system drive directory.
